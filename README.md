Alex, Gillian, Kin, and Reggie's Epic Project

![rarrrrrhhhhh](./img/bear.png)

## WHY
Our project has been designed from the beginning with our user stories in mind. 

## WHAT
We wanted a website that would clearly display the ethos of our growlingly great team.

## HOW (describing the journey to completion)

We started by making issues for each of our user stories. One pair was working on the CSS and the other on the HTML.
